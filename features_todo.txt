To Run:
make all
make run INPUT=sample_code1

make clean
make clean-all

----------------------------------

strings data_type
.stkasm- .text, .code
lw, sw
address??
libs???
Recursion??
Global variables
optimization
if-jmp remove and bne beq...
init arr to 0
for int i;
int i, j;
output("\n); not supported

arrays not working
check `Warning: Unhandled TAC line: @t3 = a - b INT`

scope_history, scope_counter in if stmts
if to add libs -> change in valid_libs, import_stmt, func_call
what is scope in class and func table?

OOPS

OOPS:
There are no explicit constructors in Car or Garage. Your code does new Car() and new Garage() — that implies a default constructor is allowed. If your language supports implicit default constructors, optionally print that fact. If not, you should detect and warn when new Class() is used but no constructor exists.

Function 'max' used without importing \"math.kik\" at line
duplicate funcs check
input output diff type of args
error even if input commented in io
if input output rules are kept in .y then if it works evn if lib is not imported

STKASM:
scratch registers- iconst local 5
local- A local variable slot in the current function’s stack frame. (user-declared variables)
temp- A compiler-generated temporary variable used for intermediate results. (compiler-generated temporaries)
istr 0 "kik code"- Define string "kik code" as string index 0
temp 7 → result of number % i
temp 8 → result of comparison == 0
temp 9 → result of not (negation)
temp 6 → result of i + 1
each function has its own stack frame, and temps live inside that frame — not shared globally.

input, output in console
check_scope func commented put at some places why
for int i = 0; i < 5;: i = i + 1:
arr out of bounds error
int a,b,c; error
memory allocation?
do while
bool
output("Hello, " << userName << "! You are " << userAge << " years old.\n");
break, continue?
scoping
tac optimization
reserved words error fix
1. Pointers and structures are not introduced to the programming language yet.
2. Line numbers in error messages in case of giving multiple files is not dealt with.
