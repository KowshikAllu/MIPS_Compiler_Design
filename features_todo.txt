To Run:
make all
make run INPUT=sample_code1

make clean
make clean-all
----------------------------------

strings data_type
.stkasm- .text, .code, lw, sw
address??

scope_history, scope_counter in if stmts
if to add libs -> change in valid_libs, import_stmt, func_call

Function 'max' used without importing \"math.kik\" at line
duplicate funcs check
input output diff type of args
error even if input commented in utils
if input output rules are kept in .y then if it works evn if lib is not imported

STKASM:
scratch registers- iconst local 5
local- A local variable slot in the current function’s stack frame. (user-declared variables)
temp- A compiler-generated temporary variable used for intermediate results. (compiler-generated temporaries)
istr 0 "kik code"- Define string "kik code" as string index 0
temp 7 → result of number % i
temp 8 → result of comparison == 0
temp 9 → result of not (negation)
temp 6 → result of i + 1
each function has its own stack frame, and temps live inside that frame — not shared globally.

input, output in console
check_scope func commented put at some places why
for int i = 0; i < 5;: i = i + 1:
arr out of bounds error
int a,b,c; error
memory allocation?
do while
bool
output("Hello, " << userName << "! You are " << userAge << " years old.\n");
break, continue?
scoping
tac optimization
reserved words error fix
1. Pointers and structures are not introduced to the programming language yet.
2. Line numbers in error messages in case of giving multiple files is not dealt with.
